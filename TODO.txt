NOTES
http://www.club-mst3k.com/212-godzilla-vs-megalon // Dailymotion and YouTube embeds. IN CHROME, THIS WILL CRASH IF THE DEBUGGER IS OPEN.
http://www.club-mst3k.com/213-godzilla-vs-the-sea-monster // Metacafe, YouTube and Dailymotion embeds. THE DAILYMOTION EMBED IS SOMEHOW FROM HULU AND DOESN'T PLAY NICE.
