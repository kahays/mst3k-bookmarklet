BUGS
- jumpstart() doesn't fire in IE off of onReady. Make it visible but with height zero so it'll fire?
- Fix IE message overlay.
- Give IDs and permanent places to UI buttons.
- Collect CSS into actual classes.
- Only works with YouTube embeds.
- Don't pollute the global namespace.

ENHANCEMENTS
- Add time selector to watch it together (like "Watch it together @ 9PM CT" or so.)
- Remove header in theater mode?
